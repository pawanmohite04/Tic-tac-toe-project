A Tic-Tac-Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based implementation of the classic game. Here's a short description:

This project creates an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using:

HTML for structuring the game board and user interface.
CSS for styling the grid, player marks (X's and O's), and visual effects.
JavaScript for handling game logic, player turns, and determining the outcome (win, lose, or draw).
Features can include:

A responsive design for smooth gameplay on different devices.
Option to play against another player or an AI with varying difficulty.
Real-time feedback, animations, and sound effects to enhance the user experience.
